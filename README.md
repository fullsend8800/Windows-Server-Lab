# My IT Lab Journal

👋 Hi! I'm Mike Siva, an experienced IT Helpdesk Executive on a mission to become a System Administrator, IT helpdesk, IT Manager.
I'm a hands-on learner building my path into IT and Systems Administration.I use this GitHub to document and version every step of my home lab journey — from Windows Server deployment to AD, GPOs, PowerShell scripting, backups, and more.

This is where I will document all my technical labs and learning progress.

## Goals:
- Learn Windows Server 2019 (Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, GPO)
- Practice Microsoft 365 Administration (users, Exchange, Intune)
- Get better at networking and security (firewalls, backups, PowerShell)

## Planned Labs:
1. Install Windows Server 2019 on VirtualBox
2. Set up a domain and create users
3. Configure DNS and DHCP
4. Explore Microsoft 365 Admin Center
