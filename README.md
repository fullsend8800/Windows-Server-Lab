# My IT Lab Journal

Hi! I'm Mike Siva, an experienced IT Helpdesk Executive on a mission to become a System Administrator.

This is where I will document all my technical labs and learning progress.

## Goals:

## Planned Labs:
1. Install Windows Server 2019 on VirtualBox
2. Set up a domain and create users
3. Configure DNS and DHCP
4. Explore Microsoft 365 Admin Center
